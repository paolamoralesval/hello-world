<h5>Short fast boring story of myself in the tech context<h5/>

<p>My name is Paola Morales. I was born in Asuncion, Paraguay in the beggining of the '90s.  I am a freelance web designer. </p>
<p>Web designing has been my carreer since i finished high school. I remember when the idea just came into my mind. I had a strong believe that designing websites was "the thing" to do. I've always been a curious and lover of tech.  I dove into this world thanks to Joomla, six years ago. My chosen learning method was and still is the self-tought. </p>
